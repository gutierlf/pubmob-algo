1st hour spent w/ 4 devs wallowing through whitespace issues when accepting approvals diffs
- absence of approvals testing experts (Emily B, Steve T)

2nd hour flowed well as we shifted the approvals to a specific unit test.
- focused on ensuring the unit test clearly described the reasons for state transition

Retro thoughts:
- we have a pattern where the first part of the 2 hour session is slow & tedious
  * we aren't always focused on the todo list
  * it's been a week and we've forgotten
  * different mix of people
  * key people aren't always there
- we also have a driver + pair smell, where one person (perhaps the "expert") is
doing most of the talking

proposed remedies for next session:

- don't forget to start by reviewing the TODO
- call out the smells when they occur
- shift to a strong navigator when some folks in the mob are unclear
    (forces people to speak through what they think they understand)
- any time we are bogging down, re-introduce the mini-retros at the end of a cycle of driver rotations (lineup? mob-adoro?)
- consider ping-pong style if we are in the flow, not timer-based rotations
