# Algorithmic Trading Refactoring Kata 

This refactoring kata will test your ability to characterize legacy code and transform complex conditionals. It is inspired by a real automated trading framework. Some of the terminology may be foreign to you, but that's okay. In a real legacy code scenario, you will find unfamiliar terms from the domain as well.

## How to use this kata

To get started, you'll need to add sufficient test coverage to make sure you do not break any of the critical algorithms. After all, one missed trade could cost our hedge fund millions! Then, take whatever approach you'd like to improve the design. Think about what design patterns may help simplify the solution.

There is one limitation. You may not alter anything in the framework package. This is provided by the platform vendor and you do not have the source.

## Requirements

Java 12
